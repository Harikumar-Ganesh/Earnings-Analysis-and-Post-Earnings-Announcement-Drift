# Earnings-Analysis-and-Post-Earnings-Announcement-Drift
A small event study project analyzing 60 earnings announcements across 15 stocks. I use abnormal returns to test whether stock prices fully react to earnings surprises or if post-earnings announcement drift exists.
NOTE: If you want to modify the data for other tickers and stocks, please feel free to, but modify the CSV file for your designated tickers. You should be able to pick a designated ETF for a field. Will work in the future to try and ensure you can also pick 15 companies based on the ETF selected :)
